# Week 7: Graph Algorithms

## Overview
Implementation of graph data structures and fundamental graph algorithms including traversals, shortest paths, and minimum spanning trees.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand graph representations (adjacency matrix vs. adjacency list)
- Implement graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- Apply shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- Understand minimum spanning tree algorithms (Kruskal, Prim)

## Files to Implement
1. `graph.cpp` - Graph data structure with adjacency list/matrix
2. `graph_traversal.cpp` - DFS, BFS, and topological sorting
3. `shortest_paths.cpp` - Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms
4. `minimum_spanning_tree.cpp` - Kruskal and Prim algorithms
5. `graph_applications.cpp` - Real-world graph problem solutions

## Key Concepts
- Directed vs. undirected graphs
- Weighted vs. unweighted graphs
- Graph traversal strategies
- Shortest path problems
- Minimum spanning trees
- Cycle detection
- Topological sorting

## Requirements
- Support for both directed and undirected graphs

- Template-based implementation
- Path reconstruction capabilities
- Comprehensive error handling

## Testing
Run tests with: `make test_week07_graphs`

## Grading Criteria
- Correct graph implementation (30%)
- Algorithm correctness (40%)
- Efficiency and optimization (20%)
- Code quality and documentation (10%)
