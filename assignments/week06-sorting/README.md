# Week 6: Sorting Algorithms

## Overview
Implementation and analysis of various sorting algorithms, from basic comparison-based sorts to advanced algorithms and non-comparison sorts.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand different sorting algorithm strategies
- Analyze time and space complexity of sorting algorithms
- Implement both recursive and iterative sorting approaches
- Compare performance characteristics of different algorithms

## Files to Implement
1. `basic_sorts.cpp` - Bubble, selection, insertion sort
2. `advanced_sorts.cpp` - Merge sort, quick sort, heap sort
3. `specialized_sorts.cpp` - Radix sort, counting sort, bucket sort
4. `sort_analysis.cpp` - Performance comparison and analysis tools

## Key Concepts
- Comparison-based vs. non-comparison sorting
- Stable vs. unstable sorting algorithms
- In-place vs. out-of-place sorting
- Best, average, and worst-case analysis
- Adaptive sorting algorithms

## Requirements
- Template-based implementations
- Both recursive and iterative versions where applicable
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Memory usage analysis

## Testing
Run tests with: `make test_week06_sorting`

## Grading Criteria
- Correctness of all sorting implementations (40%)
- Time/space complexity analysis (25%)
- Performance optimization (20%)
- Code quality and documentation (15%)
