# Assignment Descriptions

This folder contains the official PDF descriptions for course assignments. These PDFs serve as the authoritative source for assignment requirements and specifications.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Place your PDF files using this naming convention:
```
assignment-descriptions/
├── week01-arrays.pdf
├── week02-linked-lists.pdf
├── week03-stacks-queues.pdf
├── week04-trees.pdf
├── week05-sorting.pdf
└── ...
```

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### For Instructors
1. **Add PDF files** to this directory following the naming convention
2. **Update assignments** by asking me to read the PDF and modify the corresponding:
   - Assignment templates in `assignments/weekXX-topic/`
   - Test cases in `tests/weekXX/`
   - README files with requirements

### Example Workflow
1. Add `week01-arrays.pdf` to this folder
2. Ask: "Please read week01-arrays.pdf and update the Week 1 assignment files and tests"
3. I will:
   - Read and understand the PDF content
   - Update assignment template files (`array_operations.cpp`, etc.)
   - Modify test cases to match the requirements
   - Update the README with accurate descriptions
   - Ensure function signatures match the specifications
